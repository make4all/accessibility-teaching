# Accessible and Inclusivity

We hope to make this class accessible and inclusive. The class is a shared learning environment and it is
important to us to make it a welcoming environment for everyone, from
all backgrounds. We strive to treat everyone in the class with respect and
understanding.

## How does this class support Accessibility? 

We know that students in this class may need materials to be
accessible by screen reader, or may need extra time on exams. We have structured the class to be as accessible as possible to all students by default.

If you have a temporary health condition or permanent disability
(either mental health, learning, or physical health related) that
impacts your academic experience, please let us know how we can
accommodate you.

You are NOT obligated to disclose any of these issues with the
instructor, only specify if thereâ€™s any accommodations required. For
more on accessibility in this class and how we accommodate you (and
each other), please see our [Accessibility
Policy](docs/accessibility.html)
   
## What about health and wellness beyond accessibility accommodations? 

It is very important to us that you take care of your mental health throughout the course. We have built flexibility into course assessments with the goal of reducing stress. However we know that sometimes that is not enough. Everyone on the course staff is available to chat, and you can always attend office hours for a non-academic conversation if necessary. Beyond the course staff, the University of Washington provides the following resources for mental health concerns. Your anonymity and privacy are protected.
  - Please reach out to the [UW Counseling Center](http://www.washington.edu/counseling/) for any help and
    concerns related to mental health (including increased stress), available to all UW students at no cost.
  - If you are ever feeling uncomfortable and need to talk or are worried about someone close to you, it is
    highly recommended to visit the [UW Heath and Wellness](http://depts.washington.edu/livewell/programs/)
    programs. They offer resources to students that can help.
  - If you're concerned for yourself or a friend, please call SafeCampus at (206) 685-7233.

## How do you accommodate religious holidays? 

You may observe religious holidays that overlap class times. We ask
that you complete the class attendance requirements for remote
students in this case. If you have additional concerns that this
policy does not meet, please contact the instructors. In addition,
here is some potentially helpful information about UW policy:
[Religious Accommodations
Policy](https://registrar.washington.edu/staffandfaculty/religious-accommodations-policy/).
Accommodation can be requested within the first two weeks of this
course using the [Religious Accommodations
Request](https://registrar.washington.edu/students/religious-accommodations-request/)
form on UW's site.
  
## What should I do if something happens that makes me feel unsafe or excluded? 

If you have been subject to sexual harassment, you feel you have been discriminated against, our you have  been made to feel uncomfortable in any way, please tell us. You might choose to speak with your instructor, teaching assistant, the chair of the department, depending on the circumstances. 

Should you feel uncomfortable bringing up an issue with a staff member
directly, , there are a number of [Community Feedback Mechanisms and
Resources](https://www.cs.washington.edu/community-feedback) including
the [Anonymous Feedback](https://feedback.cs.washington.edu/) form,
but understand we can not respond to you directly if you use the
latter. Responses, if possible, will be broadcast to the class as a
whole or systematic changes to the class when necessary.

You can also file a complaint with the UW Ombudsman's Office for Sexual Harassment. Their office is located at 339 HUB, (206)543-6028. There is a second office, the University Complaint Investigation and Resolution Office, who also investigate complaints. The UCIRO is located at 22 Gerberding Hall.
  
If something about the course materials makes you feel excluded, please let us know. We also review them ourselves with inclusion in mind each time we prepare to teach. 

We have tried to make the course inclusive of people who  have work,
childcare or appointments that have to be prioritized at specific
times. However if we can do something to improve this further, or you have needs we haven't thought of, please tell us.
