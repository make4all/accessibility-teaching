#  Logistics 
This is an in person class. As much as possible, we ask that you
attend in person. That said, we know that many individual concerns may
make this a barrier. We will do our best to support remote
participation when there is a need for this due to a family
obligation, disability, or other concern.

## When and Where is the Class Held?

See [Canvas]({{site.canvas}}) for all zoom meeting links for classes and office hours.

- **Class Time:** {{site.time}} (PDT)

| By Appointment |        | Any     | Post to  [discussion board]({{site.discussion}}) |


*You can discuss matters with us privately on the [discussion
board]({{site.discussion}}). This notifies the whole course staff at
once and is usually faster than email.

Staff mailing list: [Mail](mailto:{{site.staff_email}})

## How do I reach other students in the class? 

We have a class [discussion board]({{site.discussion}}), where you can
make public posts that benefit the whole class, and are answered more
quickly because your fellow students can help the course staff by
responding also.

- This is the best way to ask questions about things like homework and programming
- Before posting, please search through the questions that have already been posted in case
      someone has already asked the same question.

Another great way to meet students is to come to class in person!

## How does Synchronous Remote Participation work?

When you are remote, ideally you will still participate synchronously. To participate synchronously, you need to do the following:

1. Post in [the class discussion]({{site.discussion}}/4631278) to find or report who your zoom buddy is
2. Attend via zoom and participate in discussions with the help of your zoom buddy
3. Report who your zoom buddy was, and how you participated, in your weekly survey


## Will lectures be recorded? 

Class sessions **will be recorded** when possible (guest lecturers may
refuse this). Recordings will only be accessible to students enrolled
in the course to review materials.

The University and Zoom have FERPA-compliant agreements in place to
protect the security and privacy of UW Zoom accounts. 

Students who connect by Zoom but do not wish to be recorded should:
- Change their Zoom screen name to a school appropriate screen name
that hides any personal identifying information such as their name or
UW Net ID
- Not share their computer audio or video during their Zoom sessions  (please notify us first!).
