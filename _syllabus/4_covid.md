# COVID safety

Masking is currently optional, however people in the room include those who are high risk with respect to COVID and people who live with vulnerable family members. Masks offer another layer of protection to further reduce the risk of transmission for all of us, and help to support these individuals. Thus, in this class, wearing a mask indoors when around others is recommended, and I ask that you attend class remotely if you are sick or have potentially been exposed to COVID-19.

## Why are masks passed around in class? 
According to the [UW face covering policy](https://wwwb.ehs.washington.edu/covid-19-prevention-and-response/face-covering-policy).  

>As part of the Universityâ€™s multi-layered strategy to limit the transmission of COVID-19, face coverings, particularly well-fitting, high-quality masks (e.g., N95, KN95, surgical mask) remain a useful tool in helping to limit the spread of COVID-19.

To help support the access needs of these individuals, masks will be available in the classroom as you enter, and if you would like to mask, you are welcome to make use of them. 

## When should I attend remotely? 

If you are sick or have potentially been exposed to COVID-19, **stay home**. We will not be
assessing you on attendance, so you will not be penalized for missing class to keep our community safe.

Below, we briefly describe the accommodations for students having to miss class due to potential
illness, with full information in the linked pages.

- [Lectures](index.html#lectures): Course content will be posted as a set of readings/videos
  that can be watch asynchronously. Recordings of the live class posted on course website, and all
  materials posted online.
- [Office Hours](index.html#course-support): We will host remote office hours.
  Please contact the   course staff on the [discussion board]({{site.discussion}})
  if none of the times/locations work for you.
- [Asynchronous help]({{site.discussion}}) is available via the [Discussion Board]({{site.discussion}}),
  post online to get asynchronous help from a member of the course staff.

## Do I need to maintain social distancing? 
Vaccinations and masking provide strong protection against the spread of COVID. Currently, UW does
not require social distancing in the classroom or office hours for students who are vaccinated and
wearing a mask.

Of course, some students might feel more comfortable keeping a little distance. If you would like
to keep space between you and another student, please kindly ask them to leave a space between you
and them if there is room available. Similarly, if someone asks you to maintain a space
between them, please respect that request if possible.

## What if I get sick or may have been exposed to COVID-19?

See [this FAQ](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/covid-19-prevention-and-response/covid-19-case-and-exposure-guidance) by UW on what you should do if you get
sick. You should also check out the [Remote Access](#remote-access) options listed above!

If you believe you have been exposed to COVID-19, follow the recommendations outlined in this
[flowchart by EH&S](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/system/files/resources/COVID-19-public-health-flowchart.pdf).

## What if Jen or a TA gets sick? 

The course staff is committed to keeping you safe, so we will not make you risk a potential exposure
to COVID to attend class. If one of the course staff feels ill, we will move any in-person activities
we are hosting to be purely online or have
someone else on the course staff fill in for us while we are potentially contagious.

Please make sure you check your email frequently for announcements from the
[discussion board]({{site.discussion}}) and before you attend an in-person event to make sure it is
still happening in-person. We will always try our best to give as advanced notice as possible for
any changes from in-person to remote for a day.
