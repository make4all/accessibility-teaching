# About this class

To learn how  computing can enable new solutions to accessibility, including both access to the world and access to computers? Similarly, how can a disability studies perspective guide us in developing empowering and relevant solutions to accessibility problems? This course explores both of those questions through a combination of discussions, reading, and building. In addition, by studying access technology, we can gain valuable insights into the future of all user interface technology.

<!-- Highly recommend this course to be [mandatory in CS]... I will keep the lessons learned and try to apply them in my career wherever applicable. -- 2023 student. -->

<!-- Even though I have a lot of experience with implementing accessibility in code and pushing for more accessible designs at work, I have learned a lot from this course [that I plan to take back into my workplace] -- 2023 student  -->

Access technology (AT) has the potential to increase autonomy, and improve millions of people’s ability to live independently. In addition, accessibility is a human rights issue and it is the law. If you're creating interactive technologies, you should know how to build regular interfaces that are accessible as well as understanding the value of innovating new approaches to accessibility. Disability touches almost everyone either directly or indirectly at some point in life, temporarily or permanently. Let’s create a future we will also want to and be able to be part of.

In this course we will focus on a combination of practical skills such as how to create accessible of documents, websites and apps and how to do disability based UX; advanced skills such as how to address accessibility in visualization, AR/VR and AI/ML; and forward looking topics such as intersectional concerns, accessible healthcare, and accessibility in disaster response. The largest project in the class will be an open ended opportunity to explore access technology in more depth. We will also cover disability justice and advocacy. 


## What are the Prerequisites and Expectations? 

The only requirement for this class is that you are comfortable programming and picking up new languages and tools that you have not been exposed to before. You will have some control over this, however, basic web skills are likely to be useful. The primary programming project in this class is one you design yourself. 

In addition, please familiarize yourself with the course [academic conduct]({{site.baseurl}}/academic-conduct.html) policy. Looking beyond policy, plagiarizing is a violation of disability justice and in direct conflict with the learning goals of this course.



##  What is the Teaching Philosophy and Approach? 

Many of the goals in this class center around learning by doing. This
means that hands on time trying out everything from implementation to
evaluation is critical to learning. Active learning has been [shown to
increase student performance in STEM
subjects](https://www.pnas.org/content/111/23/8410).

Thus, class time will be used as much as possible for in **class
exercises and discussion** for understanding using a variety of
technologies. We also highly encourage questions in lecture. Often
many students share the same question and those questions can help the
instructor gauge student understanding.

Preparation outside of class and participation in class are both very
important and will improve your class experience. Preparation may
include online discussion, pre-class readings and videos, and
post-lecture reflections in addition to homework. Participation in
class will include discussion, question asking, and active engagement
in learning exercises.
