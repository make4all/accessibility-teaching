## Considerations

- [No] AAC mealtime
  - The AAC user never addresses the audience
  - The  AAC user never comments on the experience of using it
- [No] Dynavox
  - It is highly scripted
  - It doesn't really review the device at hand
- [Borderline] Street crossing
  - City-produced video with first person account (see 2:10)
  - Limitations: Not universally available; Does not support DeafBlind 
  - Designed for people with visual impairments to cross the street
