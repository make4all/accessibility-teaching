# Class Access Norms & Syllabus

---
##  How is this class accessible? (1/3)

Many disabilities benefit from flexibility in how time is spent

---
## In our class this means:

- We have tried to structure the class to support you ( For example, you have up to two late days *per assignment* for assignment completion, no questions asked).
- If you need further accommodations
for any reason, talk to us and consider working with
[DRS](https://depts.washington.edu/uwdrs/) as well.

Where possible, we provide those as a standard part of the class. To that end...

## Small Group Discussion

How would you implement this in your lab or workplace? (post on our [Discussion Board]({{site.discussion}}))

---
##  How is this class accessible? (2/3)

Sometimes students with disabilities, such as chronic illness or mental health concerns (which are both very common disabilities among  college students) may need to participate in class remotely.

**Also** some disabled students may be at high risk for COVID, and should not have to worry that attending class could cause them to become ill.

---
## In our class, this means:

- We provide for hybrid participation 
- We provide masks 
- Please attend class remotely if you have an access need, a cold, flu, or suspected COVID symptoms. We will *work to ensure* you have an equal experience. 
  
Outside of this **Attendance is expected** unless you are traveling.

## How do I participate when remote?

1. You find a zoom buddy from your project group
2. You *attend via Zoom* with the help of your zoom buddy
3. You *contribute a discussion post to every small group discussion* linked to in the [class schedule/slides]({{site.baseurl}}/schedule)
4. You fill out the *remote participation survey* 

---
##  How is this class accessible? (3/3)

We commit to mutually working together to make it accessible.

- DRS approval is required for some accommodations (specifically, those that are not available to the entire class)
- But many accommodations benefit most students. This is a form of *disability justice* 

In our class, this means that where possible, we provide those as a standard part of the class. 

Notes:
Why disability justice? because access to disability documentation and comfort with disclosure are both things that are inequitably distributed

## Access is also for the teaching staff <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text"  -->

Once you learn how to make the course more accessible to the teaching staff, please do.
- Turn in accessible documents for grading (e.g. you should always provide ALT text for your images and captioned videos).
- Communicate through the discussion board or mailing list rather than emailing us individually
- Support us and each other in creating access for the whole class
