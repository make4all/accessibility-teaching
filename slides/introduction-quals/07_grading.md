# Grading

Assignment completion and participation is required. 
- This is 15% of your grade. 
- However if you simply stop attending class or doing the work, your grade will be reduced based on the amount of class you miss. 

Competencies are the other 85% 

---
## Participation
- We will consider the whole student in assigning this grade and cannot give you a definitive formula

- We take your input on this: Participation is a space where you get to choose what works best for you. 

- Some things we look at
  - Did you turn in your assignments on time / show reasonable effort on them
  - Assignment completion considers whether you did everything, not how well you did it.
  - Includes asking questions in class (**self reported**)
  - Participating in discussion and exercises (**self reported**)
  - Participation in discussion outside of class (**based on activity**)

## Competencies

We use *competency based grading* because it prioritizes *accessibility* and *justice* and *flexibility* for students.

**Traditional grading** focuses on completion of required tasks

| 85% projects | 15% participation        |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| *project 1*  | *class attendance*       |
| project 2    | asking question in class |
| ...          | ...                      |

## What is competency-based grading?
**Competency-based grading** focuses on evidence of progress and learning

| learning goal 1              | learning goal 2     | learning goal 3            |
|------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| *Evidence: Project 1*        | Evidence: Project 1 | Evidence: Project 2        |
| *Evidence: Project 2*        | Evidence: Project 3 | Evidence: Project 4        |
| *Evidence: Project 4*        |                     |                            |
| *Evidence: Discussion posts* |                     | Evidence: Discussion posts |
| ...                          | ...                 | ...                        |


Teaching and learning are centered around *learning outcomes*. This changes how we plan, assess and grade the course.

## More detail on competencies (1/2)

- Competencies are the core learning goals in this class. 
- If you learn them all well, you will do well in the class
- You will have multiple opportunities to show us you learned them

You can find all of the competencies in [Outcomes](TODO)

---
## How Competencies Translate to Grades
- On any competency, you may be rated as below competent, competent or excellent. 
 - There are TODO competencies total
 - Your grade is: TODO

- We generally expect you will to achieve competency by the second time you try something, and continue improving to excellence over the quarter. 
  - If you achieve excellence, and then stop doing a thing (such as providing alt text), your score may drop. 
  - Similarly, if you don't try to do something until the very end of the quarter, even if you do it really well, we may not rate you as highly on that competency.

## Example of Student  Competency  (1/2)


- The presentation slide deck and your first homework are mostly accessible, however you forget to describe any images. As a result, you score "Not Competent" on image descriptions.

- On your next assignment you take special care with image descriptions. You are marked "Competent" but the TA has some advice on how to be write more specific and useful descriptions

---
## Example of Student  Competency (2/2)

- You want to finish this, so the next time you include an image in a discussion post, you make sure to describe this, and ask the TA to review it. You followed their advice and you are marked "Excellent" <!-- .class="fragment" -->

- Over the rest of the quarter, you continue to describe all your images, and maintain "Excellent" in this competency <!-- .class="fragment" -->
