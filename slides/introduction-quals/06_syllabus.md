## A little more on Inclusivity

- Inclusivity does not (and should not) require disclosure, this goes for accessibility and ANYTHING else
- How can you ask for help without violating privacy or boundaries? I won't make you justify your requests for help or accommodations or pry into your life. 

Notes:
[not yet true] Especially because Biden's new Title IX regulations make me a mandatory reporter.

This is the most important thing I’m going to talk about today. Have I got everyone’s attention? You can’t miss this part

## A Note on Academic Integrity

Don't plagiarize. If you use text, quote it and reference it. Sharing is fine, but don't copy from each other. See our [Academic Conduct](academic-conduct.html) page for more details

## GAI rules ([Full Rules](academic-conduct.html#generative-ai)) 1/2

You may use GAI for assignments and exams unless I specify that it may not be used or other guidelines. However:

- Cite the AI program you used in the artifact you hand in
- If it copies  text or closely copies ideas from other sources, you must cite those sources
- Do not use generative AI to plagiarize or cheat. For example, you may not use AI to create fake data and pass that off as based on real people.

## GAI rules ([Full Rules](academic-conduct.html#generative-ai)) 2/2

You will be held to the same standards when you use generative AI as for any assignment, regardless of whether you or the AI created something, including:

- If you turn in artifacts that are not accessible, you will be graded accordingly
- If you turn in artifacts that contain false or incomplete claims, you will be graded accordingly
- You will be graded based on critical thinking and writing skills.
