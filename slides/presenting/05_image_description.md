Note: 

All of these require different strategies to describe them well.

## How to describe photographs

![Vector graphic of maple leaf](presenting/images/maple1.png) <!-- .element: width="25%" -->
![Red Maple Leaf icon](presenting/images/maple.png) <!-- .element: width="25%" -->
![Maple Leaf Icon on a Canadian Flag](presenting/images/canadaflag.png) <!-- .element: width="25%" -->

<!-- .element: width="40%" class="recenter" !important -->

Is this meant to represent a maple leaf? or Canada? How would you describe the differences between these images if all are present? Only one? 


Note: 
Although technology is getting better at recognizing what an image depicts, algorithms alone cannot understand what an image means within the context of the overall page. A maple leaf might represent Canada, or it might just illustrate the leaf of a tree. Web page authors must provide alternative text that represents the content and function of their images.

## Describing photographs 

Depends on setting. 

[Stangl et al, 2020](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3308558.3313605) asked BLV people about News; Employment; Dating; etc. 

Findings:
   - **Include whether people are present**; text; name objects 
   - Usually include activity; building features; landmarks

## Back to the maple leaf

## When to Describe Identity 
[Bennett et al](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445498) interviewed BIPOC, Non-Binary and/or Transgender Blind people.

</iframe>


Note: 
When is identity important
- Meeting new people
- Identity is the topic of discussion
- Seeking specific first person perspectives
- Want/need to understand representation in the media
- Need to "read" a room, for example to decide whether to code switch

## How to Describe Identity (1/2)

![Lezlie looks at us full front with curls down one size of her head and her long sleeve rolled up just on that side of a cowl neck wild abstract print shirt. Her smiling cheeks greet us](presenting/images/award.jpeg)

- OK to mention race, gender, and disability status in that case
- Otherwise use appearance (skin color, "person" instead of gender, AT use but not disability status)

Original announcement: Dr. Lezlie Frye has won [an award] for *her*<!-- .element: class="red"  -->
 paper; alt text (probably) written with her input.

## ALT Text with Identity Markers?

## Image Description Competency
You will be evaluated on this any time you turn in a document that has images in it. 

Image descriptions should be concise, complete and accurate. 

You should use best practices to decide when to mention the background, describe people, and so on.

**Breadth matters too** Excellence is only possible after at least two different types of images are successfully described.


---
## Try this

- Find an image of yourself online in a place you can edit*
- Update it to have ALT text
- If there is not an image of yourself that is editable, select someone else who is on a website you can edit or ask them to edit
  - I suggest a faculty member from the UW CSE faculty page whose image does not include ALT text
  - generate ALT text and check if they are OK with the description you generated.
  - I will help update the page once they approve (for CSE faculty)
  
Post your image + ALT text on [this Ed thread](https://edstem.org/us/courses/67367/discussion/5384148)!

## Image Description Competency

Image descriptions should be concise, complete and accurate. You should use best practices to decide when to mention the background, describe people, and so on.

- Short description overviews image
- Long description more complete
- Not redundant with what access tools (e.g. screen reader) already tell the user (i.e. the type of an element such as "button" or "image" is not useful to include in ALT text)

Note: 
We'll talk about this a lot this quarter because images, diagrams, videos, charts, and GUIs all require different types of descriptions. Today we will focus on photographs, because you will probably have them in your decks
