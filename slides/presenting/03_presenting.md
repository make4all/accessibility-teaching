# Accessible Presenting <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

Best practices for presenting accessibly. Pay attention and raise your hand when I fail to do this! If you catch me, you get a surprise :).

- Speak slowly and clearly
- Read entire quotes
- Describe images and videos
- Non-verbal content should be described (in the video, or by you)
- Finish on time (yes, this is an accessibility thing!)
- Share your (accessible) slides at least 1d ahead (2d is best)

## Virtual atendees

- Share a link to slides to follow along
- Read out questions from chat or ask others to do so
- Specific any accessibility needs in chat (i.e. turn your video off, or don't interrupt)

---
## Media

- Describe images with equity in mind
  - Can a BVI person follow your presentation and get the same information as someone without any visual impairment?
- Similar to [writing ALT text](05_image_description.html) (which we cover later today)

- Make sure videos are accessible
   - Videos should be captioned (at a minimum)
   - Videos should be audio described (ideally)

---
## Visuals

- 9/10, you don’t need sound effects or visual effects
- Leave space for captions
- Simplify; Avoid clutter (Embellish when you speak)

- Many [best practices in document accessibility](04_documents.html) help with presentation too

## What is clutter?

Please, for the love of all that is good on this fine planet we call home, do not do this to your poor audience members

They don’t deserve this! What did they do to you? They probably flew hundreds of miles and of all talks and things to do in this new place came to YOUR presentation. And what do you do? You greet them with this GIANT wall of text! How rude. It’s ugly to look at. It’s hard to read. It’s annoying as heck for me to type out this thing just to make a point!

So please, don’t do this to your audience members. Be a responsible presenter. Practice your talks so you don’t have to read off the slide (or use speaker notes! also okay!). Break up your content so looking at your slides isn’t like getting smacked in the face with a wall of text.

**But there are exceptions! (e.g., if you have a thick accent)**
